# Mamamoo
My project is to advertise Mamamoo. The website will be used to display information about the group, including their background, schedules and their merch. This is to help promote the group and let the website be an area where current fans of the group can check and be kept up to date with everything related to mamamoo.

## Design Process
This website is for mamamoo and the main purpose is to promote the group and let current fans have a website where they can check on everything related to mamamoo whenever they want.
