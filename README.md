# Mamamoo
Mamamoo is a South Korean four member girl group that debutedback on June 18, 2014 with their title track "Mr Ambiguous". 
My project is to advertise Mamamoo. The website will be used to display information about the group, including their background, schedules and their merch. This is to help promote the group and let the website be an area where current fans of the group can check and be kept up to date with everything related to Mamamoo. In doing this, I hope to be able to bring more fans for the group as well as ensure that current fans will not lose interest in them as well. Through this, we would be able to increase the popularity of the group and in turn, the sales of merchandise produced by the group.

## Design Process
This website is for mamamoo and the main purpose is to promote the group and let current fans have a website where they can check on everything related to mamamoo whenever they want. 

### User Stories
- As a person who is starting to gain interest in Mamamoo, I would want to find out more details about the group in a website that is easy to navigate and has all the information I need.

- As a long-time fan, I would want to check on the latest activities/schedules of the group and their members without needing to search all over for it. 

- As a major fan who wants to show support for the group, I would want to know what official products the group is selling, as well as how to buy them at the lowest price possible.

## Features

### Existing Features
Navigation Sidebar/Menu - Implemented to allow user to jump to different sections on the website page for faster and more efficient navigation. 

Welcome Video Background - for aesthetics and to welcome people onto the website.

About section - This section has 4 parts,a brief paragraph on who the group is, information regarding each of the members, their awards as well as their reality shows. Flex wrap was used on the member profiles for neater viewing and organisation. Tables were used to show the awards and reality shows for easier visualisation as well.


Music section - This section has two parts. First being the latest music release from the group including links to their albums through their official streaming sites as well as a youtube video with the main title track. Second part of this section includes all the albums released by the group as well as their solo albums in the order of year. For each album, there is a picture showing the album cover as well as names of the streaming platforms that the albums are on. When a user hovers over the streaming platform's name, the name will change colour and once clicked, it will lead them to the album on the streaming platform of their choice. Flex wrap was used here as well.

Merchandise section - Section includes a number of the official merchandise from the group, coming from different stores that are reputable. Fans are able to check out the stores that sell these products simply by clicking the button stating the shop name. Each listing will hover up when a pointer is on it and when someone proceeds to hover over the button with the shop name, the button will change colour. Additionally, there are pictures to provide visualisation on the products as well as the items name and price in Singapore dollars.
